        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in <b>South Asia</b>, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[6]
        but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7]
        Fowl
        have been known in Egypt since the <b>very</b> century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come
        from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[8][9][10]

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as
        a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and is widely used
        throughout
        North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[27]

        <p>The element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text
            separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any
            structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is
            parsed before the closing tag. See "Tag omission" below.</p>
